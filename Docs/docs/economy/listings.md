# Listings

import SellerNotification from '/docs/economy/_sellers-notification.mdx';
import ThemedCreditIcon from '/docs/economy/_credit-icon.mdx';

<SellerNotification/>

Listings allow you to monetize your VRChat content by selling rewards, such as unlocking avatars or world features.

Users can buy listings, which contain [products](/economy/products/). Each listing can contain 1-15 products. Users keep the products until the listing expires, depending on its [duration type](#2-duration-type). For example, [permanent](#%EF%B8%8Fpermanent) listings never expire, and [instant](#instant) listings expire immediately.

You can choose your listing's [visibility](#visibility). Listings can appear in your [store](/economy/store), or you can use Udon in your world to [open a listing](#udon-store-prefabs-in-your-world) directly, even if your store is not published.

Listings are similar to [subscriptions](/economy/subscriptions).

## Create a listing

You cannot change the type after creating your listing.

The differences between duration types are explained below.

<Column className='text--left'>

</Column>
</Columns>

<Columns> 
<Column className='text--left'>
#### ‚ôæÔ∏èPermanent
The duration of permanent listings is **unlimited**. Buyers gain lifetime access to the listing.

You can add the following products:
- [Udon products](/economy/products/udon)
- [Avatar products](/economy/products/avatar)

For example, you could sell permanent access to avatars, world features, or world cosmetics. 

</Column>
<Column className='text--left'>
#### ‚åõTemporary
The duration of temporary listings is **five minutes to three months**. Buyers own the listing until the duration expires, similar to [group subscriptions](./subscriptions).

You can add the following products:
- [Udon products](/economy/products/udon)

For example, you could sell temporary benefits for your VRChat world, such as boosts, cosmetics, features, or trials.

You choose the duration of a temporary listing by editing its [details](#3-details). Buyers can't purchase the listing again until its duration expires.

</Column>
<Column className='text--left'>
#### ‚ö°Instant

Instant listings **do not have a duration**. Instead, you give buyers an immediate reward with Udon. Buyers can purchase the listing as many times as they want.

You can add the following products:
- [Udon products](/economy/products/udon)

For example, you could sell spawnable items, pickups, animations, or virtual persistent currencies for your world.

Only users who are currently in your world can buy instant listings. Otherwise, the purchase screen asks them to visit your world first.

</Column>
</Columns>

Click "Next" after choosing a duration type.

#### 3.1 Pricing

You may choose a price of 100-100,000<ThemedCreditIcon/> for most listing types.[^1] You can change the price later - users who currently own your listing are be affected.

However, non-[permanent](/economy/listings#%EF%B8%8Fpermanent) listings and [avatar products](/economy/products/avatar) have the following limitations:

- Your [instant](/economy/listings#instant) listings, [temporary](/economy/listings#temporary) listings, and [subscriptions](/economy/subscriptions) may not be priced higher than 10,000<ThemedCreditIcon/>.
- If your listing contains [avatar products](/economy/products/avatar), its price must be least 1,200<ThemedCreditIcon/> per different avatar product in the listing, excluding variants of the same avatar. For example:
	1. If your listing contains two different avatars, it must cost at least 2,400<ThemedCreditIcon/> (1,200 <ThemedCreditIcon/> √ó 2).
	2. If your listing contains two variants of the same avatar, i.e. different colors or outfits, it must cost at least 1,200<ThemedCreditIcon/>.
	3. If your listing contains a single avatar, it must cost at least 1,200<ThemedCreditIcon/>.

### Delete

Click "Delete" on [My Listings](https://vrchat.com/home/marketplace/storefront/listings/) to delete a listing. You only delete listings that don't have any owners.

- [Instant](#instant) listings can always be deleted.
- [Temporary](#temporary) listings can be deleted after you [unpublish](#4-visibility) them and wait for all current owners to expire.
- [Permanent](#%EF%B8%8Fpermanent) listings **cannot be deleted** after any user has purchased them.

### Visibility

The visibility of a listing depends on its status. Open [My Listings](https://vrchat.com/home/marketplace/storefront/listings/page/1) to change the status of your listings:

- "Published" listings can be purchased by users.
- "Draft" listings cannot be purchased by users. If users already purchased the listing, they keep it.

If your listing contains any [avatar products](/economy/products/avatar), it's automatically published on VRChat's avatar marketplace. In addition, you may add it to a [world store](/economy/store).

If your listing does not contain any avatar products, users can only find it if you add it to your [world store](/economy/store) or if you have a store prefab in your world that uses Udon to open listings. (Use both to make your listings easier to find.)

:::tip
Use a combination of [stores](/economy/store) and Udon [store prefabs](/economy/sdk/examples/) to make your world listings easier for users to find.
:::

#### World stores

- Users see your world [store](/economy/store) when looking at your world in VRChat's menu.
- World stores are easy to create and manage from the [Store Manager](https://vrchat.com/home/marketplace/storefront/stores)
- The world store is visible when users look at your world details in VRChat's menu.
- Users don't have to be in your world to use your world store.

#### Avatar marketplace

- If your published listing contains any [avatar products](/economy/products/avatar), users automatically see your listing on the avatar marketplace. 

#### Udon store prefabs in your world

- You can use [Udon](/worlds/udon/) to create "Buy" buttons or custom stores inside your world.
- The [Open Listing](/economy/sdk/examples/open-listing) prefab allows you to easily add a "Buy" button that users can press when visiting your world.
- You can also create "hidden" listings that users can't find in your world store or elsewhere.
- If you're experienced with Udon, write your Udon scripts with the [Store.OpenListing](/economy/sdk/udon-documentation#storeopenlisting) method.

## Refunds

Refunds are processed on a case-by-case basis by VRChat. You cannot directly issue refunds to your buyers. If you need help issuing refunds to buyers of your listings, please contact VRChat.

[^1]: VRChat may change the Creator Economy's minimum and maximum listing price in the future. We will inform you in advance before we implement a new minimum or maximum.
