# Performance Ranks

The Avatar Performance Ranking System allows you to see how much a user's avatar is affecting performance via analysis of the components on that user's avatar. You can also use it on yourself to see how performant your avatar is.

This system is provided to inform users what is likely the most performance-heavy components on their avatars, and offer basic advice on what to look into when optimizing their avatar.

It is also used to drive the [Minimum Displayed Performance Rank](/avatars/avatar-performance-ranking-system#minimum-displayed-performance-rank-on-pc) system, which is a way for users to decide what avatars they wish to show based on their Performance Rank.

**This system is not meant to be an end-all-be-all authority on avatar performance**, but is a good general guide to indicate if an avatar needs a bit more work to be performant.
:::danger Perf Ranks are not the final word!

Although the Performance Rank system does as best as it can to judge the "worst case" scenario of an avatar's performance, there are many ways to have a well-optimized avatar appear as Very Poor, and have a FPS hog rank as Excellent.

For the technically inclined: the Performance Rank system is based on a static analysis of the avatar's properties without any consideration paid to things like animators, shaders, texture resolution, pixel lights, and many more factors. *However*, it tends to provide an excellent litmus test for detecting problematic avatars 95% of the time!
:::

## Short Version
**Aim for Good ranking.** If you can't hit that, **Medium is perfectly fine.** 

Creating avatars is already hard, and creating optimized avatars is even harder. It is a skill that takes a long time to build!

Keep in mind that many events, groups, and locations in VRChat may ask you to change your avatar if you show up in a Very Poor avatar. As such, even if you choose to use a Very Poor avatar in small instances with your friends, make sure you also have one meant for usage in instances with more people.

Your avatar affects everyone else's framerate, so be mindful of how your choices affect other people's experiences. Otherwise, they might see you as your Fallback!
## Performance Ranking Icons
When you open your Quick Menu, you'll see icons appear on top of the nameplates of users. 

The ranks are as follows:

| Icon                                                  | Performance Rank | Description                                                                                                                                                                       |
|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ![image](/img/avatars/performance-rank/excellent.png) | Excellent        | This is as good as you can get! The "Gold Star on the Fridge" rank.                                                                                                               |
| ![image](/img/avatars/performance-rank/good.png)      | Good             | Good enough! A great target to aim for.                                                                                                                                           |
| ![image](/img/avatars/performance-rank/medium.png)    | Medium           | Don't let the name fool you, Medium is plenty good. If you're here and don't want to work any farther up, you're fine.                                                            |
| ![image](/img/avatars/performance-rank/poor.png)      | Poor             | Could use some work.                                                                                                                                                              |
| ![image](/img/avatars/performance-rank/very-poor.png) | Very Poor        | This avatar has some serious performance problems. Since this rank is unbounded, it is very possible that your performance is suffering as a result of this avatar being visible. |

## Viewing Detailed Avatar Stats
If you click on a user with your Quick Menu open, you'll notice a new **"Show Avatar Stats"** button on the left side, displaying the icon of that user's Performance Rank.


![avatar-perormance-breakdown.gif](/img/avatars/view-avatar-details-qm.png)

If you click this icon, you can view the detailed **Avatar Stats** of that avatar. You can get to this for your own avatar by going to your Avatar Menu, clicking one of your avatars, and clicking the **Avatar Stats** button in the bottom left of the screen.


![avatar-perormance-breakdown.gif](/img/avatars/view-avatar-details-preview.png)


When you click the **Avatar Stats** button, you'll get a screen pop up with the details of avatar you're looking at, or your own avatar (if you clicked the button in the Avatar tab).

![avatar-perormance-breakdown.gif](/img/avatars/avatar-perormance-breakdown.gif)


The color of the text matches the rank that the particular stat "drags" the rank down to.

You'll also see a "before and after" in the form of the "Original" and "Perf Filtered" lines. If you're using the [Minimum Displayed Performance Rank](/avatars/avatar-performance-ranking-system#minimum-displayed-performance-rank-on-pc) system, you can see what the stats were before and after the system removed components. In the case of the Minimum Displayed Performance Rank system blocking an avatar for performance reasons, you'll only see the original stats.

In the example given above, Lights and Particle Systems are disabled due to exceeding the limit defined. Because Particle Systems employ at least one material each, the count of materials from Particle Systems is also subtracted from the pre-filtered avatar. 

You can also see that we link to our **Documentation**, in particular our [Avatar Optimization Tips](/avatars/avatar-optimizing-tips).
## Avatar Performance Ranking Stats
Here is a listing of all of the statistics that the system looks at and their description.

Bolded stats will cause the avatar to be fully blocked if they exceed the Minimum Displayed Performance Rank. If other stats (except for bounds) exceed the Minimum Displayed Performance Rank the avatar will only be partially blocked. The avatar will be shown with any components related to the exceeded stats will be removed. 

For example with the Minimum Displayed Performance Rank set to Poor an avatar with 9 Trail Renderers (Very Poor) will be displayed with all of its Trail Renderers removed. Refer to [Minimum Displayed Performance Rank](/avatars/avatar-performance-ranking-system#minimum-displayed-performance-rank-on-pc) for more information.

| Bounds Size                        | The total size of the avatar. If this is really huge, that user probably has a large animation on the avatar that isn't showing all the time.<br/>Important note: Bounds Size will not cause the avatar to be blocked, even if it is below the "Minimum Displayed Performance Rank" setting.                                                 |
| Texture Memory                     | The amount of memory estimated to be in use by the avatar's textures. These textures occupy space in both system RAM and in the video card's memory.                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Material Slots                     | The number of material slots on the avatar. Material slots are the slots on the mesh where you fit materials in. This is what counts toward Submesh creation, which incurs further draw calls. Keep in mind that Particle Systems will use one material slot, Particle System with trails use two, and Line Renderers use one material slot. |
| PhysBones Components               | The number of PhysBone components on the avatar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| PhysBones Collision Check Count    | The sum of how many PhysBone transforms each collider can affect. This can count transforms twice or more, because a single transform can be affected by multiple colliders.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Avatar Dynamics Contacts           | The number of Avatar Dynamics Contacts on the avatar. Does not count [receivers](/avatars/avatar-dynamics/contacts/#vrccontactreceiver) with [filtering](/avatars/avatar-dynamics/contacts/#filtering-1) set to "Local Only."                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Constraint Depth                   | The deepest chain of dependencies across all constraints on the avatar. [Click here for more detailed info.](/avatars/avatar-dynamics/constraints#performance) |
| Animators                          | The number of Animators on the avatar. Important note: This will always be at least 1 due to the root animator being counted. This means that for the Excellent ranking, you can have no additional animators.                                                                                                                               |

## Avatar Performance Ranks - Value Maximums per Rank
Below, you'll find the limits for each of the Performance Ranks. If you go above these numbers for any category, you'll be bumped into the next rank.

For example (on PC), if your avatar has 2 Skinned Meshes, your avatar will be ranked as Good, as that exceeds the rating for Excellent, but does not exceed the rating for Good. 
:::caution All GameObjects and Components are counted!

All GameObjects and Components, **including those that are currently disabled**, count towards the Avatar Performance Rank.
:::

:::caution Mesh Read/Write Disabled

If you disable Mesh Read/Write on **any** mesh on the avatar (including particle systems), the "Triangles" count will read "Mesh Read/Write Disabled" and the avatar's Performance Rank will be immediately downgraded to "Very Poor" regardless of the actual triangle count on the avatar.

The SDK warns you of this and will require that you fix it before you upload.

The table below describes the requirements for PC avatars to receive a certain performance rank:


### PC Default Performance Rank Blocking

On PC, the default Minimum Displayed Performance Rank level is "Very Poor". This means that users can see most avatars by default. If you a user enables the [Minimum Displayed Performance Rank](/avatars/avatar-performance-ranking-system#minimum-displayed-performance-rank-on-pc) system, they can choose to hide avatars with poor performance.

However, if your avatar is extremely unoptimized, VRChat may prevent you from using it. You can fix this my improving its performance rank, ensuring that it doesn't exceed VRChat's [avatar size limits](/avatars/avatar-size-limits), and then reuploading the avatar.

## Mobile Limits

VRChat on Android and iOS (phones, tablets, and Meta Quest) has stricter limits than VRChat on PC.

The table below describes the requirements for mobile avatar to receive a certain performance rank:

[^1]: Bounds Size is determined by the maximum size of all components on your avatar. Trail and Line Renderers do not count for this calculation.

[^2]: If the Very Poor value is exceeded on mobile, no matter the current "Show Avatar" state of the avatar, all Avatar Dynamics-related components will be removed.

### Mobile Default Performance Rank Blocking
On mobile, The Minimum Displayed Performance Rank is "Medium" by default. This means users can't see any avatars ranked as "Poor" or "Very Poor".

Users can set their Performance Rank Block level to "Poor", allowing them to see "Poor" avatars. However, they cannot set their Performance Rank Block level to "Very Poor".

For example, if a mobile avatar exceeds 20,000 triangles, it's "Very Poor" and users can't see it in VRChat. However, users can forcefully show "Very Poor" avatars by selecting the user and clicking "Show Avatar".

:::warning

In the future, VRChat may remove "Very Poor" mobile avatars and the ability to use "Show Avatar" for "Very Poor" mobile avatars. Please keep this in mind when creating mobile avatars.
:::

### Mobile Avatar Component Limits

Some [avatar components](/avatars/avatar-dynamics) are limited on mobile avatars. You cannot exceed the following limits:

- 8 [PhysBone](/avatars/avatar-dynamics/physbones) components
- 64 [PhysBones](/avatars/avatar-dynamics/physbones) affected transforms
- 16 [PhysBones](/avatars/avatar-dynamics/physbones) colliders
- 64 [PhysBones](/avatars/avatar-dynamics/physbones) collider checks
- 16 [Avatar Dynamics Contacts](/avatars/avatar-dynamics/contacts) 
- 150 [Constraint](/avatars/avatar-dynamics/constraints) components
- A dependency depth of 50 [Constraints](/avatars/avatar-dynamics/constraints)

You cannot bypass the limits above by using "Show Avatar". If a mobile avatar exceeds a limit, all limited avatar components are removed from the avatar in VRChat, even if you enable "Show Avatar".

### Mobile Removed Components
The following components are disabled on mobile devices since they can never appear on avatars:

  * Lights
  * Cloths
  * Total Cloth Vertices
  * Physics Colliders

These values may still appear in VRChat's avatar details screen, but they are always zero.

## Minimum Displayed Performance Rank
You can choose to manage avatars based on their Avatar Performance Rank. This option is available in the [Performance Options](https://docs.vrchat.com/docs/vrchat-configuration-window) menu, accessible as a button in the top-right of the Safety tab in the main menu.

When you choose a Performance Rank in VRChat's menu, all avatars that are below that level will have their components/display managed as described below.

### Minimum Displayed Performance Rank on PC
On VRChat for PC, the Minimum Displayed Performance Rank is set to "Very Poor" by default. This means that, by default, no avatars will have their components or display affected for performance reasons on PC. If you wish to change this, you can choose between "Medium", "Poor", or "Very Poor" options.

### Avatar Performance Rank Blocking on Mobile
On VRChat for mobile devices, the Avatar Performance Rank Block is set to "Medium" by default. You can choose to change this to "Poor" to see avatars of that rank, but your performance may suffer as a result.

You cannot disable the Avatar Performance Rank Block system on mobile. In other words, avatars that are ranked as "Very Poor" will always have their display managed VRChat for mobile, and may not display at all.

No matter what setting you choose, if the [Avatar Dynamics](/avatars/avatar-dynamics) component limits are exceeded on mobile devices, all of those components will be removed. In short, there is a hard cap for Avatar Dynamics components on mobile avatars.

### Overriding Individual Avatars
:::danger

**"Show Avatar" for Very Poor avatars functionality may be removed in the future, and Very Poor avatars may be removed from Android and iOS entirely.** Please keep this in mind when creating avatars for VRChat on mobile devices.
:::
You can choose to override the the entirety of the system (and the Safety system) by selecting "Show Avatar" on each user you wish to show.
