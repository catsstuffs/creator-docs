# Current Unity Version

The current Unity version used by VRChat is <UnityVersionedLink versionKey="patch" url="https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/<VERSION>"><CurrentUnityVersion/></UnityVersionedLink>

The simplest way to install the latest Unity version is with the [Creator Companion](https://vcc.docs.vrchat.com/#download-it). After installing the Creator Companion, simply follow the instructions. 

Alternatively, if you have Unity Hub installed, you can <UnityVersionedLink url="unityhub://<VERSION>">click this link</UnityVersionedLink> to install the correct version of Unity. <CurrentUnityVersion/> is also available in the [Unity editor release archive](https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive).

In the installation screen, choose "iOS Build Support" and "Android Build Support" if you'd like to be able to create worlds or avatars for iOS, Android, and Quest.

## Differences from previous versions

Unity 2022 includes many improvements such as faster iteration times, improved asset import times, *much* faster platform switching times, better editor stability, fully featured C# 8 support, a quick search feature, [and much more!](https://unity.com/releases/lts)


## Known Issues

* The first time you open a Scene and select a GameObject inside a prefab with a U# Behaviour, the GUI for the component directly below that U# Behaviour will not show its GUI. Deselecting and re-selecting the prefab fixes this.
* Buffer Particles don't work as they did in Unity 2019, [there is a workaround to fix them from community member hfcRed here](https://x.com/hfcRedddd/status/1696915379090604179).
* Unity 2022 sometimes causes Rider's debugger to stop for unhandled exceptions in Unity's IMGUI.
    * Please refer to [this workaround](https://forum.unity.com/threads/rider-debugger-breaks-on-unhandled-exception.1135879/#post-7305256) and [Jetbrains's bug tracker](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/RIDER-64944) for more information.
* Spatialized Audio Sources can create warnings when entering playmode or adjusting their settings.
